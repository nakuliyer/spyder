## Overview

** Note: graphics are scaled-down for demonstration, and different in-game activities have been clipped together.

Cinder Minecraft is a very basic clone of the popular video game, *Minecraft*. In this game, you can explore a randomly-generated, infinitely long terrain; you can interact with this world by breaking and placing grass blocks!

### Notable Features
* The game stores blocks in "chunks" (set to ~216 blocks by default). At any point in time, the player's chunk and all 26 other adjacent chunks are in view.
* All games initialize to a random seed. All blocks destroyed and placed by a player are saved in any instance of the game, throughout any number of chunk movements.
